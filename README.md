# Snake Game with Graph Interface

This project is a classic snake game enhanced with graph classes and a graph interface. The snake game is built with JavaScript and allows for a traditional gaming experience, while the graph functionality adds an educational twist allowing users to interact with graph data structures.

## How to Use

To run the snake game, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser and use the arrow keys to control the snake. To interact with the graph interface, switch to the graph mode within the game or open the graph interface HTML file if available.

## File Descriptions

- `snake.js`: Contains the main game logic for the snake game.
- `graphClasses.js`: Defines classes for graph data structures.
- `graphInterface.js`: Provides functions for user interaction with the graph.
- `snakeStyle.css`: Contains styles for the snake game.

## Dependencies

This project uses vanilla JavaScript and does not require any additional libraries or frameworks to be installed.

## Additional Information

Please note that the project is a work in progress and may contain bugs or incomplete features. Future plans include adding more graph algorithms and enhancing the game's UI. Contributions to the project are welcome; please submit issues or pull requests through GitHub.
